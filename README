I Learn and Play for Inkscape
Inkscape extensions for e-learning authoring

HOW TO USE

For each extension you would like to use in Inkscape, move the corresponding files
to Inkscape's extension directory.

E.g. using Ubuntu, the reveal-by-mouseover extension can be enabled in Inkscape
for all system users by moving the .inx and .xsl files in the extensions/reveal-by-mouseover
directory to /usr/share/inkscape/extensions (use sudo to copy them as you need to
be root). You don't need to copy the examples folder and/or the README file.


REVEAL BY MOUSEOVER

This extension makes it easy to generate pictures that have hidden descriptions 
and/or graphics that appear when you move the mouse pointer over them if you view
the svg in a modern browser.

It adds the required javascript to hidden objects when you save the file as type
"SVG iLearnAndPlay: reveal hidden groups (*.svg)". Any svg object (or group) that
is set to hidden in Inkscape (checking "Hide" in the Object Properties dialog)
will be "discoverable" in the output picture.
